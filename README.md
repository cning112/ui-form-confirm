# UI Form Confirm

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ui-form-confirm.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui-form-confirm)

`ui-form-confirm` is a React component that provides a customizable form confirmation dialog, based on Material-UI and React Hook Form. Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios where users need to confirm form submissions.

## Features

- Material-UI styling for consistent dialog design.
- Integrated with React Hook Form for streamlined form handling.
- Configurable buttons and messages.
- **Supports form fields in the confirmation popup**: The confirmation popup can include simple form fields, allowing for user input directly in the dialog.
- **Promise-based confirmation**: If the confirmation popup is confirmed, the form data is returned in a promise, providing a convenient way to handle form data.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by `material-ui-form`. Compared to `material-ui-form`, `ui-form-confirm` extends functionality by allowing simple form fields in the confirm dialog and supports returning form data as a promise upon confirmation.

```bash
